## Single-cell RNA sequencing and Spatial Transcriptomics of GI cancers

- We use single cell cutting edge technology and spatially resolved transcriptomics in GI cancers to understand tumors and ecosystems at single cell and spatial context to develop clinically relevant biomarkers and identify therapeutic abilities.
- We also study the mouse-models to identify constitutive pathways between humans and mouse to be used in novel therapeutics
- Our studies focus on untangling unique metastatic cellular niches to devlope effective drug therapy.
- Analysis of intratumoral heterogeneity of Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma
